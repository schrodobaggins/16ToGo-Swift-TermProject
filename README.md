This is a simple Fasting countdown app inspired by another iOS app named "Zero", created by Mike Maser and Kevin Rose

## Description

This program was created as my recent hobby of fasting to lose weight. Fasting can be extremely beneficial to lots of people to live an overall healthier lifestyle, and this app can hopefully help achieve those goals. While simple in design, the goal is simple. This app tracks and is designed to game-ify the process of fasting. This is designed around a typical 16:8 IF schedule, but can be accommodated to fit any fasting schedule tailored to your needs. I was inspired to create this app since I started using the iOS app "Zero". This app is extremely similar in design, using the Progress Bar as a wheel feature as the main draw to the homepage. This gives the user a simple, clean, and intuitive way to track progress and keep it fun. This app utilizes CocoaPods as a way to load the progress wheel, and information about that can be found in the Podfile. 
## Instructions

Running this application requires the use of Cocoapods. Make sure to install the included podfile before building and running. Best used in the iPhone 13 Pro Max models of the Xcode simulator. Not formatted well to run on the previous models.
